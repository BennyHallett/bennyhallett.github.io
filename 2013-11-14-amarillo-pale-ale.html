  <p>If you’re just starting out in Homebrewing, you may have bought yourself a homebrew kit from your local home brew store, or maybe a large chain store. My advice would be, don’t follow the instructions on the can of malt you get. </p>
<p>Ok maybe the first time you brew, use the can and follow the instructions. You’ve got the kit there, and it’ll be beer none the less.</p>
<p>However before you set off to do your second brew, read <a href="http://howtobrew.com">John Palmer’s amazing, free, online book, How To Brew</a>. It started me on the track to actually crafting beers, rather than just re-creating a soulless, store-bought one.</p>
<p><img src="assets/img/amarillo-pale-ale.png" alt="Boiling my first ever wort"/></p>
<p>This beer is the first beer I’ve ever brewed by boiling malt extract, and adding hops according to a schedule. I had an idea about the type of beer I wanted to make. I’m really loving bitter, heavily hopped pale ales at the moment, so I decided to try and create my own.</p>
<p>After looking for recipes online, I took my ideas to my local homebrew store, and with some recommendations from the brewer there, came up with the following recipe.</p>
<h1>Recipe</h1>
<p><strong>Recipe Volume</strong>: 25L</p>
<p><strong>Yeast</strong>: Safale - 05</p>
<p><strong>Malts</strong>: 2x 1.5kg Morgan’s Pale Lager liquid malt extract</p>
<p><strong>Calculated Original Gravity</strong>: 1.046</p>
<p><strong>Hop additions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>50g Northern Brewer @ 60 min
</li>
<li>30g Amarillo @ 30 min
</li>
<li>15g Amarillo @ 15 min
</li>
<li>15g Amarillo dry hop after 3 days
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Calculated IBUs</strong>: Unknown</p>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boiled 13 Litres of water, turned off heat and stirred in extract.
</li>
<li>Returned to boiling.
</li>
<li>Added 45g of Northern Brewer hops after the hot break.
</li>
<li>Boiled 30 minutes and added 30g of Amarillo hops.
</li>
<li>Boiled further 15 minutes and added 15g of Amarillo hops.
</li>
<li>Boiled further 15 minutes and turned off heat.
</li>
<li>Cooled pot in ice water bath to reduce temperature.
</li>
<li>Added wort to fermenter, and topped up with water to 15L.
</li>
<li>Pitched yeast.
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fermentation</strong>:</p>
<p>Fermenting at between 24 and 26 degrees celsius. Adding 15g of Amarillo hops after 3 days.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong>:</p>
<p>This beer was very nice. A couple of people I gave bottles to enjoyed it, and compared it to some store-bought beers. I’m not convinced it was as good as that, but it was a tasty beer.</p>
<p>The beer was quite bitter, and had a little amarillo aroma as you were drinking it. However it wasn’t the IPA style that I was going for. It was probably too bitter, and not aromatic enough.</p>
<p>Next time I brew this beer, I think I’ll be reducing the amount of bittering hops, and increasing the amount of hops later in the boil, along with 2 to 3 times the amount of dry hops.</p>

              I like to write software in both <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> and sometimes publish articles about that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recently I've become more interested in the human aspects of software engineering, and will be exploring that more often.
