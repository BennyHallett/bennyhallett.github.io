  <h3 class="post-title"><a href="2014-10-12-phoenix-on-docker.html">Phoenix on Docker</a></h3>
  <p>Today I started playing around with <a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a>, and I have to say that I’m pretty impressed.</p>
<p>Docker is a tool for packaging an application and it’s dependencies into a container, which can then be deployed, without changes, to any host that supports containers.</p>
<p>Since I’ve been doing a lot of <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> lately, I wanted to try and get a <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix">Phoenix</a> application up and running in a container. In the end it wasn’t too difficult</p>
<h2>The Dockerfile</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/BennyHallett/81ac88a788607ad876e4">Dockerfile</a> for our Phoenix app looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>FROM        trenpixster/elixir:1.0.1
COPY        . /phoenix_app
ENV         MIX_ENV prod
WORKDIR     /phoenix_app
RUN         mix do deps.get, compile
EXPOSE      4000
CMD         [&quot;mix&quot;, &quot;phoenix.start&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>This <code class="inline">Dockerfile</code> should be placed into the root directory of your Phoenix app. The instructions in the file set up our container.</p>
<p>The <code class="inline">FROM</code> instruction lets Docker know which image it should use as our container’s base. In this instance, we’re going to use <code class="inline">v1.0.1</code> of <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/trenpixster/elixir/">trenpixster/elixir</a>, which <a href="https://github.com/trenpixster/elixir-dockerfile/blob/master/Dockerfile">already has the Erlang VM and Elixir 1.0.1</a> installed on it. </p>
<p>The <code class="inline">COPY</code> instruction copies our app into the container, to the <code class="inline">/phoenix_app</code> directory. You can rename this to the actual name of your app if you want, but it will work as it is now. If you do change it though, be sure to change the <code class="inline">WORKDIR</code> line as well.</p>
<p>We use <code class="inline">ENV</code> to set the <code class="inline">MIX_ENV</code> environment variable and tell mix that we want to run in the production environment.</p>
<p><code class="inline">WORKDIR</code> ensures that every instruction we run for here on in is launched from <code class="inline">/phoenix_app</code></p>
<p>We then use <code class="inline">RUN</code> to call out to mix and download our dependencies, then compile the app.</p>
<p>The <code class="inline">EXPOSE</code> instruction tells the container to listen on port 4000, the same port that Phoenix runs on.</p>
<p>Finally, we call <code class="inline">CMD</code>, which is the instruction used to start our app. We use mix to run the <code class="inline">phoenix.start</code> task, and we’re up and running.</p>
<h2>Building the image</h2>
<p>Now that we have our specification for our container, we can build it by running:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo docker build -t &lt;your_username&gt;/&lt;app_name&gt;</code></pre>
<h2>Kicking off our container</h2>
<p>We need to run our image with a couple of switches. <code class="inline">-d</code> will force docker to detach, and run in the background. <code class="inline">-p</code> will redirect one of our system’s ports to the <code class="inline">4000</code> port of the container, allowing us to point our browser at the app running in the container.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo docker run -p 8088:4000 -d &lt;your_username&gt;/&lt;app_name&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now you can point your browser at <code class="inline">http://localhost:8088</code> and you should see the app running inside the container.</p>
<h2>Stopping the container</h2>
<p>Since the container is running detached, we need to get docker to stop it for us.</p>
<p>If you run</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo docker ps</code></pre>
<p>you will see the currently running containers, and their ids. Given the container id, you can stop it with</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo docker stop &lt;container_id&gt;</code></pre>

  <h3 class="post-title"><a href="2014-09-15-parsing-and-transformation.html">Parsing and Transformation</a></h3>
  <p>If you’re yet to watch the <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/events/elixirconf2014">talks from ElixirConf</a>, do yourself a favour and go check them out. The one’s I’ve seen so far have been amazing.</p>
<p>The first one that I watched is <a href="http://twitter.com/pragdave">Dave Thomas’</a> keynote talk <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/4119-elixirconf2014-opening-keynote-think-different">Think Different(ly)</a>. This talk transformed the way I think about programming in Elixir. Dave explains how he tackles a new language by writing a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> parser, and how he came to understand programming in Elixir as parsing and transformation.</p>
<p>Lets look at a simple example to get us started. Say we have an API, and we want to have our endpoint take an identifier, returning some information about cats. We want to keep it fairly clean, so we only return the information that the caller would expect from this call, rather than all the data that we have related to this identifier.</p>
<p>When we think about this, we have a few things we need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receive the input
</li>
<li>Look up the record
</li>
<li>Select only the relevant cat information
</li>
<li>Turn it into JSON
</li>
<li>And send it back to the client
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the core of it, the processed described above is transforming one piece of information, <em>the identifier</em>, into another, <em>the JSON packet</em>.</p>
<p>We can make use of Elixir’s pipeline to make these transformations in an obvious way.</p>
<pre><code>defmodule My.Api do
  def get_data_about_cats(id) do
    id
    |&gt; load_record
    |&gt; select_cat_info
    |&gt; jsonify
  end
end</code></pre>
<p>Now lets look in depth at the <code class="inline">select_cat_info</code> function. Again, this function is taking one form of data and transforming it into another, but we can think of it in terms of parsing. We can assume that the function is passed a list of tuples, each containing an atom and another piece of information.</p>
<p>We want only the information about cats, which are all tagged either <code class="inline">:cat</code> or <code class="inline">:feline</code>. We have some additional requirements. Anything tagged <code class="inline">:food</code> that comes before a <code class="inline">:feline</code> tag needs to also be included, as does anything tagged <code class="inline">:grooming</code> that comes after a <code class="inline">:cat</code> tag.</p>
<p>Doing this in an object oriented language seems like it might be daunting. It obviously involves looping over the array and picking out the values tagged with either <code class="inline">:cat</code> or <code class="inline">:feline</code>. The difficult part becomes picking out the preceding or trailing tags based on the rules given. When we see <code class="inline">:food</code>, we have to keep track of it just incase the next item has a <code class="inline">:feline</code> tag.</p>
<p>It’s the edge cases that make these problems difficult.</p>
<p>When we move to a parsing solution, the edge cases can be clearly described and don’t seem out of place at all. We can solve this problem as follows:</p>
<pre><code>defmodule My.Api do

  def select_cat_info(record), do: _select_cat_info(record, [])

  defp _select_cat_info([], output), do: output

  defp _select_cat_info([{ :food, v1 }, { :feline, v2 } | tail], output),
    do: _select_cat_info(tail, output ++ [{ :food, v1 }, { :feline, v2 }])

  defp _select_cat_info([{ :cat, v1 }, { :grooming, v2 } | tail], output),
    do: _select_cat_info(tail, output ++ [{ :cat, v1 }, { :grooming, v2 }])

  defp _select_cat_info([{ :cat, v } | tail], output),
    do: _select_cat_info(tail, output ++ [{ :cat, v }])

  defp _select_cat_info([{ :feline, v } | tail], output),
    do: _select_cat_info(tail, output ++ [{ :feline, v }])

  defp _select_cat_info([ _ | tail ], output),
    do: _select_cat_info(tail, output)

end</code></pre>
<p>These function definitions are quite lengthy, and I’m sure that we could clean them up, but the basic idea is there. We’ve got a list of items, and we’re adding them into the output list based upon the 4 given rules. The other functions include the termination case (when the input list is finally empty), and the default case, which ignores the item that matches none of the above rules, and looks again at the tail of the list.</p>
<p>How do we handle error cases?</p>
<p>This technique also makes these error cases quite explicit. Using pattern matching and multiple function definitions, we can be clear about our error cases without polluting our main parsing code with if statements checking for pre-conditions.</p>
<pre><code>def select_cat_info(nil), do: error(&quot;Cannot select cat info from a nil record&quot;)
def select_cat_info(record) do
  ...
end

def error(msg), do: raise Error, message: msg</code></pre>
<p>Thinking about code in terms of data transformation and parsing certainly twisted my brain, but once I’d got my head around it, it was surprisingly effective. In the cases I’ve used the technique, I was able to quickly come to a solution that was obvious, but also obviously correct. I had one test case, and code which performed it’s job for all cases, ensuring that every additional test went green straight away. It was an odd, but refreshing, feeling.</p>

  <h3 class="post-title"><a href="2014-07-28-peasant-evm.html">Peasant evm (Elixir Version Manager)</a></h3>
  <p>When starting out with Elixir I wanted a way to be able to switch versions easily, without uninstalling a previously installed version. Since Elixir changes frequently, and given it’s young age and that it’s coming up on a stable 1.0 version, it’s not out of the question that some changes will be breaking changes. I’ve had this come up recently, where one library I was using required the 0.14.3 version of Elixir, but another library hadn’t yet been made 0.14.3 compatible, so I had to quickly roll back to 0.14.2.</p>
<p>Having experience using <a href="http://rvm.io">rvm</a> and <a href="http://github.com/capistrano/capistrano">capistrano</a> in several of my Ruby projects, I was inspired by some of the techniques they use for switching versions, and <a href="https://github.com/BennyHallett/peasant-evm">peasant-evm</a> was born.</p>
<p>Basically I’ve just got my elixir installs in a directory, each under their own version number, and a <code class="inline">current</code> symlink which points to the one I want to use.</p>
<pre><code>/opt/elixir/0.14.1
/opt/elixir/0.14.2
/opt/elixir/0.14.3
/opt/elixir/current -&gt; /opt/elixir/0.14.3</code></pre>
<p>On top of this, I’ve got <code class="inline">/opt/elixir/current/bin</code> in my path, so that I’m always using whichever one <code class="inline">current</code> is pointing to, and a shell script that allows me to quickly switch between versions.</p>
<pre><code>#! /bin/bash
rm /opt/elixir/current
ln -s /opt/elixir/$1 /opt/elixir/current</code></pre>
<p>As the name suggests, it’s pretty simple at the moment. It might be fun to expand on this further, creating a tool that installs Erlang and different versions of Elixir in much the way that rvm does. The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/BennyHallett/peasant-evm">here</a>.</p>
