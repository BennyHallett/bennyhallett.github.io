thoughts: "A gripping tale of a mans survival alone on Mars. I'm not a fiction reader and I couldn't put it down. As always, the book is better than the movie"

This is the first fiction book I've read in a long time. I'm not normally a fiction reader, but figured I should
give The Martian a try since it's been widely reported as a great book. I had expected it to be good, but good
was an understatement.

The story is mostly told as a series of log entries recorded by Mark Watney, the astronaut who is stranded on Mars.
On hearing this, it may turn you away but don't let it - it's told in a very interesting and engaging way.

Occasionally the story steps out into a 3rd person perspective, and tells the story of the people back on Earth
trying to save Mark. 

On reflection the story follows a repetitive path, but it wasn't really noticable while reading it. Mark goes
through various situations in which he has a problem and describes in his log entries his plan to fix it. Then
we have a time jump to his next entry where we find out the results, and how he plans to adapt to the success or
failure of that exercise.

The story was gripping. The various problems Mark faces, his innovative solutions and the way the story is written
kept me wanting to read more. There was always a new problem, a new - potentially fatal - solution to try out. He escapes 
death several times, but I never felt sure that he'd get off Mars alive.

I'm not sure if you'd classify it as hard sci-fi, but much of the science Mark undertakes is quite detailed. He covers off
concepts in physics, biology and chemistry in a way that seems very detailed but never over your head. The science seems plausible
to me, given my entry level knowledge of some of the topics covered.

Another interesting aspect of the story is that it's set in a not-too-distant, very possible future. As of today, Humans are again
looking to space, and there are companies planning to take humans to Mars. The missions are set out in a way that seems sane to me, 
by sending pre-supply missions that can automatically prepare some of the base site, before actually sending the people up. It's easy
to think that we could have people experiencing these situations within the next 20 years.

On Mark's mental health - he manages to stay much saner that I would expect a person to, trapped all alone on a distant planet for
over a year. Although he does - for a period of time - re-establish a communication link with Earth.

The book is - as you might expect - much better than the movie. That isn't to say the movie is bad, it was actually pretty good. Understandably
some large parts of the book were left out - most notably the trip between the 2 landing sites where Mark comes close to disaster twice. The movie
also slightly modifies the rescue scene, making it less plausible but slightly more entertaining.
