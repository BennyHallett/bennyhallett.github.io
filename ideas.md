I have lots of ideas, many of which I do absolutely nothing with.

Feel free to use these as you wish, I just ask that if you do write or build
something based off these ideas, please shoot me a link so I can check it out!

### Writing

* We really need very little
* Education as a life long pursuit and how to raise kids accordingly
* It's ok to abandon your projects
* Elimination and Automation
* Leaving a legacy - getting to really know parents, grandparents. Giving kids
  that opportunity
* Avoiding debt
* Decadence and the number of vices we have. (junk food, binge tv, internet
  time-sink)

### Projects

* What would a platformer game look like if it was multiplayer?
* Write a book about building real-time systems from scratch - a full-stack
  approach
* A sports new website for australian sport -> Similar to Bleacher Report
