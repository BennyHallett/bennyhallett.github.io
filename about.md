Hey, I'm Benny Hallett, a Software Engineer from the Central Coast of NSW. I
live there with my wife, son and daughter.

I'm a passionate programmer who loves learning new things. At the moment I'm all
about [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) and [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org), but who
knows what the future will bring.

During the week I work for a startup, and in my own time work on some of [my
own projects](/projects). You can check out [what I'm up to right now](/now).
