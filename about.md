Hey, I'm Benny Hallett, a Software Engineer from the Central Coast of NSW. I
live there with my wife, son and daughter.

I'm a passionate programmer who loves learning new things. At the moment I'm
learning to build systems using [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) and
[Elm](http://elm-lang.org). I'm also interested in application security.

I'm a minimalist. Technically I'm a really bad minimalist, but the ideas behind
minimalism really resonate with me and I'm always trying to reduce the amount of
items I own that don't add value to our life.

I'm learning about Stoicism - a philosophy based in the real world. Be concious
of the things in your life that are in your control, and don't worry about those
which aren't -> you can't do anything to change them. I'm enjoying the letters
of Seneca and the [meditations of Marcus
Aurelius](http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html)

During the week I work for a startup, and in my own time work on some of [my
own projects](/projects). You can check out [what I'm up to right now](/now).
