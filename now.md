Inspired by [Derek Sivers'](http://sivers.org)
[NowNowNow](http://nownownow.com), here is everything that I'm focussed on right
now (In order of time spent).

* Working my job as a software engineer
* Spending *quality* time with my family
* Contributing to some Elixir open source projects
* Reading [Building scalable applications with Erlang and OTP](https://erlang.org)

These are the current things that are important to me, and anything else I'm
likely to say no to. If these change, I'll update them here.
