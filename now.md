Inspired by [Derek Sivers'](http://sivers.org)
[NowNowNow](http://nownownow.com), here is everything that I'm focussed on right
now (In order of time spent).

* Working my job as a software engineer
* Spending *quality* time with my family
* Building [these projects](/projects)
* Reading [these books](/books)
* [Weightlifting](http://stronglifts.com) and following the [Slow carb
  diet](http://fourhourbody.com)

These are the current things that are important to me, and anything else I'm
likely to say no to. If these change, I'll update them here.
