    <p>I’ve begun taking <a href="http://sivers.org">Derek’s</a> approach to reading, by taking
notes about the books I read and keeping them somewhere that I can get to
easily. It’s only fitting that the first book for me to add is his.</p>

<p>I’ll start by saying I really enjoyed this book, it was quite entertaining.
Not only does it give some sound advice to consider when building and growing a
business, it does it using interesting stories. I found that this helped to
provide some context around the advice, which is always useful when making
decisions in the future.</p>

<p>The main takeaway that I got from this is that success will come if you create
things that help to solve people’s problems. Create things that people want and
need, and especially things that people ask you for. If you actually care about
helping people and always do what would make the customer most happy, then
you’re setting yourself up for a win.</p>

<p>Don’t be on your deathbed, having squandered your 1 chance at life, full of
regret because you pursued little distractions rather than big dreams.</p>

<p><a href="https://sivers.org/hellyeah">Hell yes, or No</a> -&gt; A principle that can help you avoid saying yes to things
that you’re not 100% committed to, and making that time available for things
that you are committed to.</p>

<p>It doesn’t cost a lot of money to start helping people.</p>

<p>Make yourself unnecessary to the running of your business.</p>

<p>Take the 1 little thing that you’re aiming to help people with, and envision how
that would work in a perfect world. Ask people how that would work in a perfect
world. That is what you should build.</p>

<p>Success comes from persistently improving and inventing. If there’s a problem,
solve the problem, don’t keep going hoping that it’ll go away. You don’t have to
go through the obstacle, you can go around it.</p>

<p>Focus on helping your existing customers. Delight them and the will tell
everyone about you. Case in point, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCIXkbfgR6g">the squid story from CD
Baby</a></p>

<p><a href="https://sivers.org/multiply">Ideas are a multiplier of execution</a>.</p>

<p>Having many smaller customers is prefereable to a few large ones. The demands or
loss of any one customer is less impactful. Please the majority of your
customers.</p>

<p>Be clear about who your product is for, and who it’s not for. Excluding people
who don’t fit your products vision and goals will win over those that do.</p>

<p>It’s hard to know when to sell or leave a project, but if your heart isn’t in
it, and that’s having an effect on how well you’re customers are being taken
care of, then maybe it’s time to hang up the boots.</p>
